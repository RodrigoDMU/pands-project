## Programming and Scripting - Project Iris

This repository was created as part of the [Programming and Scripting](https://www.gmit.ie/programming-and-scripting) assessment module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics?_gl=1*1bcdos0*_ga*MTE3OTU2MzQ5LjE2OTY2MDYwMzE.*_ga_5R02GBYV8V*MTcxNDMzOTE2Ni4xMS4xLjE3MTQzMzkyMDAuMC4wLjA.) at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. [[1]](#1) This project is using the dataset [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) to demonstrate the skills developed in the course in data analysis and visualization. [[2]](#2) You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## About This Project

This project is about the [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset that contains 150 observations of three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor, with 50 observations each.

Each observation consists of four features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), and petal width (cm).

## Use of This Project

This project is useful for demonstrating some of the skills developed for analysis, programming and data visualization using Python (.py), Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and ReadMe.md.

## Getting Started

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the [`analysisjn.ipynb`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/pands-project/blob/main/analysisjn.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
